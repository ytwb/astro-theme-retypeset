My laptop cannot be placed steadily on the table. It also had a hole in the lower left corner. I did not get to the bottom of it. One day I turned on the computer and "no hard drive device installed" error message popped up. I was completely at a loss. After restarting computer, it worked normally but I was worried about all those photos in the drive would disappear. I just downloaded them from school's OneDrive as the service had been terminated. I had not backed up those photos. I then started to investigate the back of the laptop and found that the lower right part was not flat. I just realized it is because of the swollen battery inside it. I worried it would explode one day and googled if it was possible to use the laptop after taking out the battery. The answer is yes. I watched some videos on YouTube showing how to take out the battery and decided to take it out by myself.

Laptop model: HP pavilion 14 cd

The first step is to take out the screws. I watched the videos and knew that there were hidden screws under the rubber strips. They were easy to be taken out. We could use ph1 screwer. There were 3 smaller screws along the side of the laptop and I did not have suitable screwer to be used. I bought EZ WORK - SCREWDRIVER SET in Japan Home Centre on 6/6. However, I still could not unscrew the screws. They were too tight. I planed to buy a more professional screwdriver kit which was Xiaomi Electric Precision Screwdriver. I asked my boyfriend whether it was good and he said he had non-electric version and could lend it to me. Spending two hours to figure out I should use ph0 screwer as I successfully took out two screws. Yet the screw near the hole became stripped. I googled how to remove stripped screw and tried to put rubber band between screwer and screw. The situation was worse. The "+" shape almost became a "O". I googled how people remove stripped screw in lihkg and found that he used the rotary tool to make a thin cut in the stripped screw so we could remove the screw by using a flathead screwdriver. I decided to follow this method and ordered the rotary tool in taobao on 8/6.
